Disappointed For Product,"I purchased this product at it hot delivered in just 15 hours,But I am totally disappointed because this Camera not works if you remove charging,It only works when I connect it with the charger,I don't know the issue,I return this.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Average action camera,"Its not fully 4k cam as mentioned it is interpolated 2880√ó2160 res. So i don't find recording on 4k res recomendable. You will not get that much clearity. As my experience ,indoor and night shoots not so impressive as you can see grain on videos as well as on pics. I have not used it in regular basis, so i can't comment on battery backups.. but as i have used it, i think battery backup is desent. It will last 45min or less on full HD 1920. Plus point is it has touch screen, which is more convenient and easy to control the UI. They also provide suffiecnt aceccerious for beginners. If you are a pro, i would recommend you should go for GoPro.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Camera is good, cheated on mounts","Camera is absolutely nice, but the accesories are pathetic and has worse quality,Already received damaged parts of Mounts and most bad par is , they are not providing j hook and default mounts are not compatible to any j hooks, you have to purchase extra mounts with j hook, this clear cheat other Amazon doing or dealer, I am traveling in 5 do us to Ladakh hence unable o een replace now, so on complet loss of purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Charging port is wrong. FPV port on camera whereas the charging cable is mini USB.,The charging port is supposed to be mini USB but the SJ6 Legend I have got seems to have FPV port.

"Stupid Gyro stabilization, doesn't connect to your phone always.","The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Lost my SJCAM 6 legend after 3 months, thanks to it's awesome screw on the rotating J mount that they have provided. I can't believe it is such a small screw, it's my fault as well, I shouldn't have used that mount, but there was no alternative (I might be wrong).- They say that the gyro stabilization is good, I would honestly say that it's pathetic. If I mount the camera on the helmet, the shake can't be seen. But, if I take a shot using my hands, it fails miserably.- The app is a dumb app, it gets connected once and then it won't connect at all. You will have to restart your phone and then restart your camera, it very annoying when you have to do this all the time. Also, if by any chance your phone  is connected to your camera (first thank god) and if you happen to take it underwater, it gets disconnected just immediately! So, you have no clue what's happening underwater in case you wanted to keep it there.- Though there are many mounts, but they should have given a proper J mount that can be attached to the chin area of the helmet. I'm truly depressed because of this loss.- There is a waterproof screen attachment that is provided for the waterproof casing, which is so useless that it is better to use the present case as it is.- The touch is really nice but the options that are there in the camera, some are actually very stupid. It's irritating actually, some don't make any sense or you won't find any difference. But then, with such a budget you can't expect so much as well.- The wide angle is good, quality is not that great, you really can't compare this to GoPro's quality, obviously you will be disappointed.-2K and 4K are a joke, record at 1080@60FPS if you want some quality videos, you don't have a choice unfortunately.All I want to say is that, if you can wait for some time, save some money and get a GoPro, then that would be a better option that getting this camera. I might be venting everything out, but I lost my camera because of the rotating J mount. Also, if you have any friend of yours who owns an SJCAM, ask them for their honest opinions. Don't just believe on one YouTube review or online reviews, do a thorough research before you buy a camera. Go ahead if you want it immediately.P.s. the 3 stars are actually 2.5 stars for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars

It's a good competitor to the more expensive action cameras around and can hold it's own in terms of build quality and picture quality.

I could not return this product before the return window as I was in middle of the trip. It ruined trip too.

Good set of Accessories (also good quality) so need not spend too much apart from a shoulder band and chest band)4. All in all good at this price, definitely with the pennyCons - (can be improved)1. Picture quality and modes below 1080p are not upto mark, and something to do with low lighting.I have done an unboxing with review and test shots video which you can look into.

Cheap Camera but having problems.,"I bought sjcam4000 only about one month back. After the initial charging from the supplier, the battery is not charging now. I do not know whether the problem is with the battery or the camera. No problem with the charger.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Good quality product but late delivery via amazon,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frfNbPQS-7YI bought it in Rs.7499 http://amzn.to/2iNkk92First time users it's worth it, if you are going for an action camera you will not be disappointed by its features and its power.Cons:1 to 1.5 hrs battery backup, will suggest you to buy more spare batteries http://amzn.to/2jeIGpd",4.0 out of 5 stars
Amazon Charging extra!!? Camera awsome.,Really good camera and replacement service considering the price we are paying. (‚Çπ6999~‚Çπ8500 Fluctuates)Yes we can purchase it @ $65 from gear bestand with import tax it cost around ‚Çπ5500. Amazon India charging extra but we are getting the EASY* replacement capabilities. Camera is great for moto vlogging and water sports and even for a dash cam. 1080p 30 fps. BUT NEVER UPGRADE UR FIRMWARE. it creates the wifi connection problem.,3.0 out of 5 stars
Best action can in this price range,Using this from past 5 months on my rides. Very nice quality videos. Perfectly waterproof as I have used in pool to take underwater shots. Only weak point is the mounts that come in the box. They can't withstand  too much stress.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Three Stars,Good product for those on tight budget!!!!!!!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars
Good action cam for the price range,Cam quality is good enough for this price range but not as good as a Sony handicam. Vast difference in the video clarity is evident when you compare a video shot under good light and one shot in twilight. The casing and the holders supplied with the cam are sturdy and quite good. Have not yet tested the water proof case. Audio recording is good enough.,3.0 out of 5 stars

Excellent stuff,"Though its the base model, functions available are more than sufficient for a regular rider. Image quality and video quality are good. Built quality is excellent though the display resolution is not as expected. But worth the amount.",5.0 out of 5 stars
100% Value for money and good quality,"The camera is very good, I was first skeptical about placing this order since it was not fulfilled by Amazon, however the seller BrainFreezer was very prompt in his service and I can gladly say that I do not regret my decision for placing this order, coming to the camera, it is 100% as described, the video quality is crisp and clear, image quality is not that good, but gets the work done, also, my purpose of this purchase was mainly for videos and not for photos, hence the lack of quality in the images does not bother me much, on the other hand, the video quality is very good, 1 minute of 1080p footage weighs in around 240-250 mb of size, I'm using a 32GB micro SD card, due to this reason, the video quality is so good that it needs the support of a good memory card, Overall BEST performance for the price range. Couldn't have asked for more.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The daytime video quality is just awesome but the dark parts or the night time videos are a bit grainy..

camera stucks at the bootscreen,Delivery was on time but there are few issues with the camera.It stucks at the boot screen and I have to wait overnight so that the camera behaves normal.

But the official website of sjcam says that the latest firmware version that is available for this particular camera is 1.2 Also near the battery cover, there are holes to vent heat in original camera. The carema that I got did not have these vents.",1.0 out of 5 stars
